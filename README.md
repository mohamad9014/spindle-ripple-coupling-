determination of TFR(time-frequency representations) and PAC ( Phase amplitude coupling ) and SI (synchronization index  )

Firstly,  separate the seconds of each event from rem, nrem, wake.Then, the data is filtered by 7-16 HZ and fs=1250 frequency.I showed the parts of NREM,REM,WAKE with numbers 3, 2 and 1,respectively.
I used the range of 0.5 to 300 Hz with 3 cycles of the low frequency cut off and finite-impulse-response (FIR)  to display the signal.I separated the data and times of NREM for both channels and then filtered them between 7-16 HZ And using function FINDSPINLDE detected spindles
